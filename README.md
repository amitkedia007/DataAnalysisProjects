# YoutubeChannelAnalysis
All the Data Analysis related projects are uploaded here.

Here I have taken top five Indian YouTube Channels and analysed the data:

1. I have collected the channel IDs of five channels from YouTube.
2. Using YouTube API, I have imported all the data with the help of GoogleApiClient
3. Then, I had arranged all the data: Channel Name, Subscribers, Views and Total Videos Uploaded, in a table frame using Pandas Library
4. Make visiualization of the data using Seaborn Library
5. Similarly, I have extracted all the data related to all the videos uploaded by the channels. And analyzed videos uploaded per month, do number of 
    subscribers affect the total videos on the videos, etc.
    
Conclusion: Most of the videos have more number of views as compared to that channel's number of subscribers
